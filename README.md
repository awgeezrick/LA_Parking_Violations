# LA_Parking_Violations
Just a quick foreword: this contains the **source code and jupyter notebooks html only** since the data is far too big to upload. The raw data is available through kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations

The point of this side project is to create a map of LA according to parking tickets received from last year (2018) and to produce some helpful visualizations. I want to start with the full dataset (~9-million x 19, saved as a .csv > 1gb) to gain more experience handling large .csv files that are cumbersome to work with in excel and are slow to work with in Python unless processed in batches (especially when you don't have much RAM available).

The code is commented to help explain my logic, and the Jupyter Notebooks file contains some other helpful descriptors/has a nice layout.
